Birth/death date: June 1915-May 2021 (Working on getting more specifics)
Birthplace:  Brooklyn, NY
Education:
      * Graduated from high school as a valedictorian at age 14
      * Undergrad at Brooklyn College (AB in Psychology)
      * Studied under noted social psychiatrist Solomon Asch
      * PhD at Columbia University
      * She earned 2 PhDs
      * Studied under Franz Boas, and was his last PhD student
      * Susman had a deep fondness for Boas which really shows in the recorded interview cited above at the Society of Applied Anthropology
      * Also earned a degree in social work
Family overview:
      * German Jewish family, multi-generational household
Fields of interests:
      * Linguistics
      * Winnebago Ho-Chunk grammar (PhD thesis)
      * Worked closely with Sam Blowsnake, a Ho-Chunk man, on creating a transcription of sound combinations and words of the Ho-Chunk language
      * Blowsnake had worked previously with other anthropologists, notably Paul Radin
      * Tsimshian linguistics
      * Anthropology
      * Acculturation on Native American reservations (PhD thesis)
      * Also studied life and economy in Switzerland
      * Social work
      * Took on social work jobs when she was unable to attain academic work
      * Genetics
      * Studied Huntington’s disease
Partners/spouses/children:
      * Husband: Elias ‘Dutch’ Schultz
Affiliations (organizations):
      * University Hospital at the University of Washington
      * Studied genetics here
Awards:
Obstacles encountered or overcome:
      * Academic options for women were few and far between, and she was regularly passed over for academic positions
      * In terms of what she could study, her options were fairly limited- most graduate programs in Anthropology in the 1930s still did not admit women, however Franz Boas was an exception to this, hence the number of female anthropologists who studied under him
      * A friend of Schultz’s, Irving Goldman, recommended Boas’s program to her, as Columbia’s graduate programs at the time were not friendly to women or Jewish people
      * Due to publishing conflicts on her first PhD thesis, she was forced to undertake a second dissertation. She later published the original thesis independently and thus qualified for two PhDs.
      * The actual conflict remains a subject to debate. Some sources cite a “legal” issue, others say it was due to rivalry or to Schultz’s frank description of America’s genocidal campaign against Native populations


Possible collections/artifacts to reference:
      * Correspondence between Schultz and Boas are included in the Franz Boas Papers

Fields of interests:
                  * Astronomy
                  * Pickering assigned Leavitt to the study of variable stars of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, as recorded on photographic plates taken with the Bruce Astrograph of the Boyden Station of the Harvard Observatory in Arequipa, Peru.
                  * She identified 1,777 variable stars.
                  * Leavitt looked carefully at the relationship between the periods and the brightness of a sample of 25 of the Cepheids variables in the Small Magellanic Cloud (also published a paper on this)
                  * In 1913, Leavitt discovered T Pyxidis, a recurrent nova in Pyxis, and one of the most frequent recurrent novae in the sky with eruptions observed in 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1967, and 2011
Partners/spouses/children:
Affiliations (organizations):

Awards:
                  * In 1908 she published her results in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College, noting that the brighter variables had the longer period
                  * Leavitt was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the American Association of University Women, the American Astronomical and Astrophysical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an honorary member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers
Obstacles encountered or overcome:
                  * In the early 1900s, women were not allowed to operate telescopes
                  * ​​Because Leavitt had independent means, Pickering initially did not have to pay her (make it make sense??)
