After graduating from the University of Vienna, she had difficulty securing a stable position and worked several jobs in industry and at various universities. In 1923, she took an unpaid position at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 1938, she was force to leave Austria following the German annexation of Austria. Albert Einstein helped secure a position for her in Mexico, but she left for the United States in 1938 due to poor research conditions. There, she joined the US Atomic Energy Commission and worked at several universities. In 1960, she returned to her unpaid position at the Austrian Academy of Sciences due to a medically necessary operation she could not afford to have in the US.

However, her most popular works include Under the Sea (1941), The Sea Around Us (1952), The Edge of the Sea (1955), and Silent Spring (1962). In the 1950s, Carson conducted research into the effects of pesticides on the food chain, condemning the DDT pesticide. Although she had been criticized by the chemical industry for her outspoken opinions on DDT, even having a large campaign developed to discredit her research findings, she continuously expressed the danger pesticides have on marine life and wildlife. DDT was eventually banned after the influence of her research, helping shape the government's environmental consciousness and motivation to preserve wildlife. After suffering from breast cancer for quite some time, Carson died in Silver Spring, Maryland at age 58.",

Educated in Lausanne, Kharkiv, and Moscow, Danchakoff became the first woman in Russia both to receive a medical degree and be appointed a professor. In 1915, she moved to the United States and took a position at Columbia University. Danchakoff made many important discoveries in embryology and was one of the first to provide a theoretical explanation of stem cells. During the 1920s, Danchakoff was a tireless advocate for scientists in the Soviet Union and organized relief efforts to publicize the struggles of and provide support to scientists during the Russian famine of 1921-22. After her unit was dissolved in 1934, Danchakoff returned to the Soviet Union, taking a position in Lithuania; however, she remained a US citizen. During the 1930s, she demonstrated the key role played by hormones in mammalian sex differentiation. Evidence in the Warren H. Lewis papers suggest she was forced from her position and returned to the US in the late 1930s, but it is unclear what happened to her after that. Nonetheless, she continued her research up until her death in 1950.",

Born into a well-off family, Edinger received and exceptional education and studied zoology and paleontology in Heidelberg and Munich. She completed her doctoral dissertation at the University of Frankfurt, and then became a curator of vertabrate paleontology at the Naturmuseum Senckenberg. During this time, she discovered that the sediment remaining in mammalian fossile skulls could be used to reconstruct the shape of the creature's brain. In the 1930s, Edinger continued her work at the Naturmuseum Senckenberg in secret to avoid persecution by the German state. She left Germany for London and then later the United States in 1938. In the United States, she worked at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, where she continued her research on mammalian evolution.  ",

In 1913, she received a fellowship to conduct research at Yale and subsequently became the first woman member of the Yale Graduate Faculty. She continued working on developmental biology in the United States until 1918, when anti-German sentiment during World War I led to her imprisonment. She had been accused of poisoning the local water supply and importing viruses. She was then deported and struggled finding work in Germany. Nonetheless, she created a department for experimental cell research at the Charité Hospital in Berlin and helped advance the state of cytology considerably in Germany. In 1933, she was falsely accused of being Jewish and of having helped secure positions for Jewish students. She was jailed again. However, international pressure led to her release. Erdmann is still remembered as one of the most consequential figures in cell biology.",

In collaboration with Eugene Opie of the Henry Phipps Institute at the University of Pennsylvania and the Rockefeller Foundation’s International Health Division, Isaacs treated local tuberculosis patients and collected research data for Opie's lab in the late 1920s and early 1930s. She worked closely with Opie and Phipps Institute statistician Persis Putnam on comparative studies on tuberculosis, comparing the spread of the disease in Jamaica with its spread in Philadelphia. In her correspondence with Opie, Isaacs repeatedly attributes the spread of tuberculosis in Jamaica to social reasons such as poverty or inadequate housing; however, in more recent years, these studies have been critiqued for conflating these social conditions with the patients' race.

She spent parts of the 1930s in hiding and was unable to work in a university lab as a result of Mussolini's Race Laws; however, she refused to give up her research and set up a small lab inside her bedroom. After the war, she was recruited to work as a doctor before returning to lab work. At Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri, she discovered Nerve Growth Factor, which opened many doors for the treatment of cancer, dementia, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's. Alongside Stanley Cohen, Levi-Montalcini won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of nerve growth factor. She was dedicated to ensuring that other scientists would have the resources and support they needed, so she founded and directed the Institute of Cell Biology, founded the European Brain Research Institute, and established the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation to help support the education of African women. She was also elected to hold a lifelong Senate position in Italy in 2001.",

McClintock's research focused on maize, and she traced genetic transfer through the changes in the colored kernels of maize. In the 1930s she discovered \"crossing over,\" in which chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes. In the 1950s, she discovered the occurrence of transposable genetic elements and their effect on gene expression; that is, that genes are not fixed like pearls on a string but that they move or \"jump\" around. McClintock's findings were ignored, partly because the complex development patterns of maize were not as clear to everyone else (especially non-maize geneticists) as they were to her. However, when these findings were confirmed in independent studies of bacteria, she received wide acclaim for her earlier work. McClintock remains the only woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.",

Along with Otto Hahn and her nephew Otto Frisch, she discovered and developed a theoretical explanation of nuclear fission. Born into a Jewish family, Meitner was the second woman to receive a doctorate in physics in Austria and worked with Max Planck in Berlin. She collaborated with Hahn for over thirty years, studying radioactive isotopes. In 1938, she was forced to flee and took a position in Stockholm, but faced difficult working conditions due to the misogynistic prejudices she encountered. She met secretly with Hahn in Copenhagen where they conducted the first successful experiments in nuclear fission. Although Hahn led the experiments, Meitner and her nephew worked out the theoretical explanation. Their discoveries became the basis for the Manhattan project, a project Meitner refused to touch out of ethical concerns. In 1945, Hahn was awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of nuclear fission, but Meitner's contributions were overlooked. Element 109 was named meitnerium in her honor.",

In the 1950s and 1960s, she turned her attention to mouse genetics while conducting research at the University of Chicago and the Fox Chase Cancer Center. Mintz was interested in a lethal blood disorder, but the mice embryos were not viable long enough for study. She developed a process for fusing two mice embryos, creating a \"chimeric\" or allophenic mouse. These fused mice allowed Mintz not only to study the blood disorder, but also to understand how complex organs formed during development. In the 1970s, Mintz used this technique of creating allophenic mice to study cancer. By fusing the embryos of mice susceptible to liver cancer with those of mice that were not, she demonstrated that cancers were grown from a single cell or unit of cells rather than a combination of cells. She also determined that both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to the development of cancer. In her later years, Mintz experimented with injecting DNA directly into an animal's egg cell, paving the way for later developments in gene therapy.",

Called \"the most significant creative mathematical genius\" by Albert Einstein, Noether's mathematical discoveries pushed both mathematic and physics forward. Born in Erlangen, Germany, in 1882, Noether was the daughter of noted German mathematician Max Noether. She was educated at the University of Erlangen and taught there without pay. In 1915, Noether took on a position at the University of Göttingen, also without pay. While she later received a paying position, her career in Germany was cut short when she had to flee on account of being Jewish. She settled in Bryn Mawr, where she continued to teach until her early death in 1935. In physics, she is best remembered for Noether's theorem, which allowed for new developments in classical and quantum physics. In mathematics, Noether is credited with laying much of the groundwork for the development of abstract algebra. Florence Sabin wrote many letters to raise funds for a memorial fund in Noether's name.",

She also authored numerous papers on tuberculosis, malaria, and other matters of public health. Some of the work done by Putnam, Opie, and Isaacs has been criticized for its focus on race in the spread of tuberculosis.",

Although Sponer was not Jewish, she lost her position after the German surrender of power to the Nazis due to prejudice against women scientists. After a brief sojourn in Oslo, Sponer received a position at Duke University in 1936 thanks to the efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation. She remained there until her retirement. Sponer's scientific contributions were primarily in the field of quantum mechanics. She set up a spectroscopy lab at Duke, which allowed her to confirm experimentally several predictions in quantum mechanics.",

She is a molecular geneticist known for her contributions to the field of transposon biology, specifically on the roles of plant transposable elements in gene and genome evolution. Her laboratory has pioneered the use of computational and experimental analyses in the identification of actively transposing elements. She received her Ph.D. in 1980 in Biochemistry from Cornell University. As a postdoctoral fellow of the American Cancer Society at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Baltimore (1980-82) she was involved in the molecular isolation of the Ac and Ds transposable elements that were first discovered by Barbara McClintock almost 40 years earlier in maize. She began her career at the University of Georgia in 1983 where she remained until moving to UC Riverside in 2010. Wessler has contributed extensively to educational initiatives, including co-authorship of the widely used genetics textbook, Introduction to Genetic Analysis. As a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor (2006), she adapted her research program for the classroom by developing the Dynamic Genome Courses where incoming freshman can experience the excitement of scientific discovery. She is the recipient of several awards including the the inaugural Distinguished Scientist Award (2007) from the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA), the Stephen Hales Prize (2011) from the American Society of Plant Biologists, and the Excellence in Science Award from FASEB (2012). She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (1998), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2007), the Royal Society (2017), and was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2013.",
