Graduated Vassar in 1884. Then went to University in Zurich to study medicine where she took courses with Stohr and Klebs (pathologist). In 1889 Welsh and Mary Sherwood took their first course in bacteriology together with Professor Eichhorst. ""Dr. Welsh has often told me that Dr. Sherwood was a young woman of radiant beauty, so much so that everywhere she created wonderment at her determination to study medicine. Hers was a beauty of feature and of coloring that became intensified rather than faded with years."" In 1890 Welsh and Sherwood returned to America. Welsh as Assistant Resident in the State Hospital for the Insane at Norristown PA, and Sherwood in Baltimore where she practiced medicine with Dr. Kelley. Welsh joined Sherwood in Baltimore in 1892. In 1894 she became Lecturer in Hygiene at Bryn Mawr College and Director of Health. At about the same time, Dr. Welsh was made Director of Health at Goucher College. Sherwood and Welsh seemed to work in childhood medicine along with women physicians Helen C. Putnam, Gertrude Knipp, Josephine Baker and Julia Lathrop. Sabin writes that she was ""an ardent, not a passive liberal."" And reflects that others will likely write on her work with suffrage and public affairs. See copy of Sherwood eulogy/obituary that FRS wrote for more details. Series I, Box 20",,,,,
